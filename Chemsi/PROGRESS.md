# 🧪 Project Chemsi - Progress Log

## ✅ Completed Milestones
### 🛠️ Infrastructure & Setup
- [x] **Environment Setup**: MSYS2/MinGW (g++) installed and added to Path.
- [x] **Environment Setup**: Python 3.12 installed and libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) ready.
- [x] **Architecture**: Folder structure created (`cpp_engine`, `python_interface`, `data`).

### ⚛️ Micro-Scale: Matter & Chemistry
- [x] **Atomic Theory**: `Atom.h` refined with Mass, Radius, Charge, and State.
- [x] **Periodic Table**: `ElementCatalog.h` created (K, H, C, O, Fe, Cu).
- [x] **Chemical Agents**: `ChemicalAgent.h` base class with virtual reaction logic.
- [x] **Specific Implementation**: `PurpleK.h` created ($KHCO_3$) with stoichiometry.
- [x] **Reaction Logic**: Implemented Thermal Decomposition ($2KHCO_3 \rightarrow K_2CO_3 + H_2O + CO_2$).

### 📦 Meso-Scale: Physics & Environment
- [x] **Container System**: `Projectile.h` created to transport chemical payloads.
- [x] **The World**: `Environment.h` defined (Room dimensions, Air Density, Gravity).
- [x] **Obstacles**: `Rack.h` created (Server Racks) with Bounding Box collision detection.
- [x] **Ignition Logic**: Racks can "catch fire" and transfer heat to projectiles.

### 🎮 Macro-Scale: The Engine
- [x] **Simulation Loop**: `main.cpp` implemented with time-stepping (`dt`).
- [x] **Interactive Controls**: Added Keyboard Support (Play, Pause, Speed Up, Slow Down).
- [x] **Data Logging**: `DataLogger.h` implemented to export telemetry to `.csv`.
- [x] **System Integrity**: Full Compilation (`g++`) successful with zero errors.

## 🚧 Next Steps (The To-Do List)
### Phase 2: The Data Pipeline (Python)
- [ ] **Data Ingestion**: Write Python script to read the `interactive_log.csv` generated by C++.
- [ ] **Visualization**: Create a 3D Scatter Plot (Matplotlib) to visualize the flight path.
- [ ] **Telemetry Analysis**: Plot Temperature vs. Time graphs to prove reaction triggers.

### Phase 3: Physics Refinement
- [ ] **Aerodynamics**: Implement Drag Equation ($F_d$) and Wind effects from `Environment.h`.
- [ ] **Particle Spawning**: Upgrade the engine to handle *multiple* particles (Vectors) instead of just one.

### Phase 4: Final Validation
- [ ] **Scenario Testing**: Run full simulation of Purple K hitting a fire.
- [ ] **Report Generation**: Automate the creation of the final research graph.
